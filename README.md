A basic python script to allow controlling of heating, fan, and AC electronic relays over HTTP requests.

I used this in conjuction with a Rasperry Pi 5 and Home Assistant. [HA's Rasperry Pi GPIO Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/remote_rpi_gpio/) doesn't work with the 5's, so I used the [RESTful Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rest/) instead.
